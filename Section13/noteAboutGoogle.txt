In the following lecture, Playing With Google Code Along, you'll be changing the logo on the google website using the src attribute. However, this method no longer works. Instead, use the srcset attribute to change the logo image.

If you are having difficulty, you can read more about how to do this here.

Additionally, if you're visiting google.com and getting redirected to your country's version of google, then try visiting this link instead. - https://www.google.com/ncr

Lastly, if you'd rather be able to follow along directly with the lecture then please use this example website that I created instead of google.com

Thanks,
